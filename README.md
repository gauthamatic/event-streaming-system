# Real-Time Event Streaming System for Ride-Sharing Analytics

A real-time event streaming system built with **Java 21**, **Spring Boot 3.x**, and **Apache Kafka** to process and analyze ride-sharing data.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Understand Kafka architecture (producers, consumers, topics, brokers)
- Implement real-time data pipelines
- Process streaming data with Kafka Streams
- Build analytics dashboards
- Handle data at scale
- Implement monitoring and alerting

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Event Producer Service** - Simulates ride events (ride requests, driver locations, ride completions)
2. **Stream Processor Service** - Processes events in real-time using Kafka Streams
3. **Analytics Dashboard** - Visualizes real-time metrics

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Apache Kafka
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Maven/Gradle
